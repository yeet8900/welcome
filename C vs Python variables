In C, variables are locations. For example, let's say
Variable names in C are just references to location, at compile time the variables are replaced with memory locations.

Essentially, there exists a mapping between a location and the variable name, and at compile time, the value of the memory location is taken directly instead of the variable.
int x =10;
int y =11;
 y=x; // what this statement does is that it changes the value that exists "in" y's location to the value that exists in x's location
 
 whereas in python,
  x=10
  y=11
  y=x
  x and y are just tags pointing to the two objects (10 and 11). They are not memory locations
